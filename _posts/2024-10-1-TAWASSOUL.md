After the period of French colonialism, Morocco incorporated the French language into its educational system and daily life. The concept I developed involves introducing Arabic phonetics into French-Arabic translation dictionaries to facilitate learning pronunciation.

The goal of this approach is to support linguistic evolution and assist non-French speakers in improving their fluency in French, especially regarding pronunciation.

This project will come to life through a poem published in a special edition, illustrating the layering of elements under the name تواصـل
