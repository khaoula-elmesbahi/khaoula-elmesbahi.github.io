Through this edition, I have explored in-depth the social issues between men and women, as well as the tensions within a patriarchal society where roles and expectations are often rigid. I have also addressed the internal conflicts of the individual, highlighting how society can sometimes be in opposition to the personal development of the man himself.

The edition uses powerful illustrations and explanatory text to shed light on these issues, while conveying the essential message under the slogan «تعلـم تسـمع,» which encourages listening and mutual understanding. This work aims to promote collective awareness of the challenges individuals face in a society marked by gender stereotypes and rigid social expectations.
