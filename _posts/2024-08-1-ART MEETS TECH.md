The «Art Meets Tech» exhibition, a collaboration between Galerie 38 and the Polytechnic University of Benguerir, highlights the synergy between contemporary art and new technologies. This event brings together a selection of Moroccan contemporary artists whose works explore the interactions between creativity, innovation, and digital transformation.

Through immersive scenography and a dialogue between various artistic disciplines—painting, installation, digital art, and multimedia—this exhibition questions the role of technology in contemporary artistic creation.

To complement this unique experience, an exclusive catalog will be produced, offering an in-depth reflection on the exhibited works, the artists’ visions, and the challenges of this convergence between art and technology.

The «Art Meets Tech» exhibition thus aligns with a dynamic of research and transmission, where art becomes a vector of innovation and a field of experimentation at the intersection of the digital and the sensory.
