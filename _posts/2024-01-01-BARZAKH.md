For this edition of the Rencontres Chorégraphiques de Casablanca, I designed the visual identity of «Barzakh», a project exploring duality and the transition between two worlds.

I created a hybrid typographic logo blending Arabic and French, reflecting the concept of in-between spaces. The yellow color, central to the design, symbolizes light, energy, and awakening, resonating with the essence of choreography.

Through this identity, I aimed to capture movement, transformation, and cultural dialogue, while staying true to my engaged artistic approach.
