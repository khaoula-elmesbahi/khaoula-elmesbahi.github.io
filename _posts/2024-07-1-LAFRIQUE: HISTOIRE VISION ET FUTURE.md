Organized in collaboration between Galerie 38 and the Université Polytechnique de Benguérir, this exhibition highlights the richness and diversity of contemporary African art. Bringing together a selection of renowned artists from across the continent, it fosters a dialogue between past, present, and future through various artistic expressions, including paintings, sculptures, installations, and new media.

Our artistic approach seeks to explore Africa’s cultural heritage while showcasing innovative visions that shape the future of art on the continent. Each artwork presented reflects identity, social, and political issues, offering multiple perspectives on Africa’s artistic evolution.

As part of this initiative, a catalog of the exhibition will be produced to document this unique event. This catalog will serve not only as a visual archive but also as a tool for reflection and analysis on the impact of contemporary African art in an ever-changing world.
