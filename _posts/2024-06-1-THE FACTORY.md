The artistic direction of the «The Factory» exhibition, themed around Pop Art, in collaboration with Gallery 38 and the Polytechnic University of Benguérir, presents a vibrant and innovative exploration of contemporary African art. This project highlights a new generation of African artists who reinterpret the codes of Pop Art through their visual practices and engagement with unique social, cultural, and political realities.

The selection of works, ranging from painting to sculpture and multimedia installations, showcases the diversity and richness of contemporary African art while fitting within the global Pop Art tradition. The exhibition draws inspiration from Andy Warhol’s visual universe and his pop icons, incorporating African references, vivid colors, and innovative techniques that open dialogues between cultures.

To accompany this artistic immersion, a catalogue has been produced, offering a detailed presentation of the works, artists, and their creative processes. This catalogue becomes an essential educational tool, enriching the experience for visitors and students at the Polytechnic University of Benguérir. It also serves as a valuable testament to the dynamism and modernity of African art on the international scene.
