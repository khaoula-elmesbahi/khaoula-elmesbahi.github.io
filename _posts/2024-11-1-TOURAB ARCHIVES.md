Synergy Project: Moroccan Women Potters in Collaboration with Haute EÃÅcole Condorcet, Belgium

The project is an online exhibition program aimed at supporting and preserving the ancient art of pottery, a tradition passed down from mother to daughter in Morocco. This program will establish a protocol for the conservation of this unique culture, while promoting the sharing of skills within the Tourab collective and beyond.

The project will also serve as an online archive, documenting all the pottery created by these talented women. Their stories, techniques, and testimonies will be shared through this virtual exhibition, thus highlighting their heritage and their contribution to Moroccan artisanal culture.
