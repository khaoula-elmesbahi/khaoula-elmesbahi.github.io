As part of a unique collaboration between Galerie 38 and the Polytechnic University of Benguérir, a major exhibition highlights the young contemporary Moroccan art scene. Under meticulous artistic direction, this event brings together a selection of emerging artists whose works reflect the richness and diversity of contemporary art in Morocco.

The exhibition is accompanied by the production of a dedicated catalog, showcasing the artistic approaches, creative reflections, and visual universes of the participating artists. This essential publication helps anchor this initiative within a dynamic framework for promoting and archiving contemporary Moroccan art.

This intersection of art, research, and innovation illustrates the shared commitment of cultural and academic institutions to the development and dissemination of art in Morocco. 

This event is a major milestone in honoring an artist whose influence continues to inspire current and future generations.
