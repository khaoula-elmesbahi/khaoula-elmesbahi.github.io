An illustration executed in Chinese ink on paper tells the story of Diabou N’dabo, a young girl with an extraordinary destiny. In this work, the delicate lines of the ink draw Diabou’s face, portraying a fearless teenager determined to carve her own path. She lives in a picturesque village, surrounded by majestic landscapes and ancestral traditions. But Diabou N’dabo is not like the other girls her age.

She dreams of adventure, freedom, and emancipation. Every line and shadow in the illustration narrates a chapter of her journey: her challenges, her encounters, and her quest for self-realization in a world full of constraints. This illustration, both simple and profound, immortalizes the spirit of a young heroine who, despite the trials, keeps her eyes fixed on the horizon, ready to face whatever stands before her.
