Galerie 38 in Casablanca is hosting Vogue, an exhibition that highlights the richness and diversity of contemporary African art. Under meticulous artistic direction, this event brings together two established mentor artists and four promising young talents, fostering an intergenerational dialogue around contemporary creation.

The exhibition stands out for its immersive scenography, designed to enhance the artworks while creating a strong visual and emotional experience for visitors. Each artist contributes a unique universe, reflecting the many facets of todayâ€™s African art scene.

As part of this initiative, a catalog has been produced to accompany the exhibition. More than just a documentation of the showcased works, it also features critical essays and interviews with the artists, offering a deep insight into their creative process.

Vogue thus establishes itself as a major event, celebrating innovation and the dynamism of the contemporary African art scene at the heart of Casablanca.
